I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Systems Lab at Cornell, advised by Professor Zhiru Zhang. I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in Spring 2021, where I performed research under the advisement of Professor Andr√© DeHon. My current research interests are in high-level synthesis and FPGA place-and-route tools. Specifically, I am interested in improving the accessability of FPGAs to computer scientists with little to no hardware design experience.
