title: "Reducing FPGA Compile Time with Separate Compilation for FPGA Building Blocks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-12-09-prflow
excerpt: 'Today&apos;s FPGA compilation is slow because it compiles and co-optimizes the entire design in one monolithic mapping flow. This achieves high quality results but also means a long edit-compile-debug loop that slows development and limits the scope of design-space exploration. We introduce PRflow that uses partial reconfiguration and an overlay packet-switched network to separate the HLS-to-bitstream compilation problem for individual components of the FPGA design.'

Today&apos;s FPGA compilation is slow because it compiles and co-optimizes the entire design in one monolithic mapping flow. This achieves high quality results but also means a long edit-compile-debug loop that slows development and limits the scope of design-space exploration. We introduce PRflow that uses partial reconfiguration and an overlay packet-switched network to separate the HLS-to-bitstream compilation problem for individual components of the FPGA design.
